# UpScaling

This is a build-up for my plans on an image stitcher. These enhancements make it easier for the algorithm to understand the images. There are many computer vision libraries involved in the process.

(This was a project given to me by a friend when I was 17. Although I didn't complete it, the experience helped me secure an internship later on. I learned a lot from experimenting with OpenCV.) 

[OpenCV Documentation on Non-Local Means Denoising](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d5/d69/tutorial_py_non_local_means.html)

At the time, I didnt see this. The fact that I considered using filters before training models to enhance the dataset was a key factor in getting the internship.
