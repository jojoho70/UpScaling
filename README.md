# UpScaling
This is a build-up for my plans on an image stitcher. These just enhance the images, so it's easier for the algorithm to understand there is a lot of computer vision libraries in it.
(this was a project given to me by a friend when i was 17, I ended up not completing it but I managed to get an internship later on from it. I learned alot with just experimenting with opencv)
